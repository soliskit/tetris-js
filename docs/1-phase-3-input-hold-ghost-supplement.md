# Phase 3 input, Hold and ghost supplement

Bounded candidate observations, not findings disposition, accepted oracle, complete correspondence or certification. Phase 3 remains open. No game code, public-site content, permanent tests, CI or executable-model changes. Evidence remains separate from the clean author.

## Environment and provenance
Node22.23.3 and actual Chrome154.0.8037.57, headless Linux,1000x900 viewport, local static production page. Gamepad values are explicit standard-mapping snapshots replacing navigator.getGamepads, not physical hardware. V7 constantMath.random0.3 without injectedclock; V8-V10 andV13 use injected Playwright browser clock and constant Math.random0.3. Clock advancement is not real elapsed timing or device evidence. Canvas centers/previews, DOM focus and labels are projections, not complete authoritative-state adapters.

Coordinator atOctober5 approximately17:18PDT compared every actual file in the served public directory with Git main789fb7 bytes:16files equal. Independent review compared all16manifest sizes/hashes to Git and found public bytes unchanged from0f4e510. Reviewer did not read the served directory or attest historical executions. Today's equality is not historical-run attestation.

## Gamepad snapshots v7 (INP4/STA1)
Five cases, source/JSON reviewed without independent browser rerun; all recorded errors empty.
- Menu+A at opening yields spawnS and no locked blocks: bounded suppression contrast.
- A+padUp locks exactlyone S and spawnsL: same-action deduplication in this fixture.
- Menu+View at opening yields spawnS. This pixel result cannot distinguish priority, since View has no visible effect there. No priority proof.
- Dialog starts Cancel-focused/paused; right moves focus to NewGame and holding right across polls keeps that focus; A closes dialog and starts game.
- B closes dialog, keeps spawnS and Resume label. No full dialog/control frame proof.

## Controlled clock v8 (INP2/D18B12/D34)
Three cases, reviewed source/JSON without independent browser rerun. Native Playwright keyboard events plus supplied pad axis, no hardware/OS repeat claim.
- Held keyboardLeft, newer stickRight, then centered stick produces left1/right1/left1 column changes. Compatible with ordered-token interpretation, but also with a fixed stick-priority implementation; not a discriminator between them.
- A and ArrowLeft both pressed; releasing ArrowLeft while A remains held stops observed repeat during200clockms. Separate physical-source interpretation remains a candidate; no classification or complete token projection.
- HeldLeft pause/resume before DAS leaves geometry unchanged immediately; advancing170clockms after resume moves two more columns. This bounded observation is a candidate contrast to held-at-resume suppression, not a source-rule change. Older wall-clamped elapsed probes could hide movement counts and are not this evidence.

## Hold v9 (PLY7/PCE3)
Canvas current/held/queue semantics observed, not production getters as expected oracle. Declared RNG fixes a production queue fixture, not independent bag-order prediction or fairness proof. StartS/emptyHold/queueL,I,Z. FirstH gives currentL/heldS/queueI,Z,J. SecondH identical. Space locksL at(18,5),(19,3),(19,4),(19,5), currentI; H restores originalS spawncells(0,4),(0,5),(1,3),(1,4), heldI, queueZ,J,O unchanged. RepeatedH again identical. Actual screenshot inspected: spawnS,heldI,queueZ/J/O,lockedL clear. Independent source/JSON/geometry/pixel review, no browser rerun. Production centering interpretation is not uniquely settled. Topout, resetcount/lowest, all kinds and full state frame remain unassessed.

V13 adds one clockwise-rotatedS case: initialrot0 cells above, ArrowUp producesrot1(0,4),(1,4),(1,5),(2,5); Hold storesS by previewcolor, replacementLlocks, then Hold restoresSrot0initialcells. Actual JSON assertions and independent source/JSON/geometry review support this bounded reset-to-start observation, without browser rerun. Held preview is color-only in JSON, not proof of heldshape orientation. Final screenshot is byte-identical to v9, consistent with identicalfinalstate; it cannot show rotationstep or attest which run produced it. Rotation evidence rests on JSON, not this screenshot. Other kinds, CCW, not-fit/topout, flags/count/lowest remain open.

## Ghost v10 (PLY5)
Independent expected landing from observed current and locked cells: maximal downward translation within20x10 bounds avoiding locked occupancy. No production ghost/dropDistance expected oracle. EmptyS predicts drop18/cells(18,4),(18,5),(19,3),(19,4); lockedS/currentL predicts drop16/cells(16,5),(17,3),(17,4),(17,5). Corrected actual outline sample sets equal these in both fixtures; independent reviewer recomputed drops/sets and inspected screenshot, no browser rerun.

Measurement is implementation-informed and post hoc: firstalpha>120 missed even-row stroke96/102, while odd-row edges128 passed. Alpha>40 admitted neighborbottomedge49. Final eightnear-top samples/cell, alpha>80/color-spread>35 isolates bothimages. Expected translation unchanged. Failed sampler/code/JSON preserved. A premature equality summary was immediately corrected; only corrected JSON supports finite equality. This tuned classifier is not independent universal pixel oracle; other colors, overlaps, DPR, canvas sizes, browsers, physical display and accessibility remain open.

## Remaining scope
Physical gamepads/touch/keyboard, Safari/iOS, OS gestures, elapsed deadlines, disconnect handling, all focus states, accessibility and complete authoritative/composite frame projections remain open. These finite cases do not close requirements or Phase3. No finding disposition or new normative source is adopted.
