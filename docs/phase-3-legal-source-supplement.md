# Phase 3 supplemental legal-operation source-citation record

Candidate citation record. Read-only check against fetched PR78 head 173fbc16ccfd3a8668a125ffe2f346fd7724e3d1. No changes to PR78, requirements, rules, model, production, tests or CI. This is a citation/content check, not independent adoption provenance, runtime frame proof, complete writer inventory, or certification. Governing decision status remains in the ledger and original owner exchanges; document wording is not action authority.

Existing L03/L19 were not the nineteen pending rows and remain outside this supplemental check. Source hashes below are actual Git bytes from the fetched head, not reconstructed API text.

## L01
L01 confirmationopen: assignedA10pending/A11Cancel,onlypaused. F allothers. W03,W22. Checkpoint relation pendingGMversusdeferredfocus unresolved. Source-citation check pending for this row; do not treat its assignments as independently verified.

Source: D32 Part A op1 line15; D18 B12 lines51-55; REQUIREMENTS STA-1 line62
Check: Confirmed for confirmation open only while paused. A10 pending/A11 Cancel. No ordinary gameplay assignment.

## L02
L02 selectionchange: assignedA11only whilepending. F allothers. W23,W24. Nativefocus/checkpoint mappingopen. Source-citation check pending for this row; do not treat its assignments as independently verified.

Source: D32 op2 line16; STA-1 line62; INP-4 line87; D18 B12
Check: Confirmed A11 selection while pending. Physical-input bookkeeping may be a separate operation; native DOM focus correspondence not proved.

## L04
L04 direction/controlpress: A12token ordered (modifiedCmd/Ctrl/Alt neverheld);gameeffect separatelegaloperation. A13progressiononlywhenrepeatstarts underL06. W25-W27. F remaining,composition recordrequired. Source-citation check pending for this row; do not treat its assignments as independently verified.

Source: D32 op4 line18; D18 B12; INP-3 line86
Check: Confirmed A12 physical token/order; modified presses never held. Gameplay effect is separate. A13 progression requires repeat operation, not arbitrary control press.

## L05
L05 direction/controlrelease: A12tokenremoved/newestremainingwins;disconnectreleasesallINP4;repeat consequenceL06. W25-W28. Release-repeat timingpartial notguessed. Source-citation check pending for this row; do not treat its assignments as independently verified.

Source: D32 op5 line19; D18 B12; INP-2 line85; INP-4 line87
Check: Confirmed token removal/newest remaining. Disconnect releases everything in INP-4. Repeat timing and held-on-resume suppression require C3/E2/E3.

## L06
L06 repeatprogression: A13phaseadvances,idlewhenpaused/over/blur;eachrepeat move/softdrop nested. Resources stopwithmode. W27-W29,W08,W19. A12doesnotbecomearbitrarydiscardablefromphase rule. Source-citation check pending for this row; do not treat its assignments as independently verified.

Source: D32 op6 line20; D18 B12/B13; INP-2 line85
Check: Confirmed repeat phase/progression and nested moves/soft drops. Phase idle while paused/over; blur stops repeat. B13 distinguishes outstanding firing from handle.

## L07
L07 touchbegin: A14perB12/INP5;controlsactualfallingpiece. F rest. W30. No sourceautomaticpauseinputexception. Source-citation check pending for this row; do not treat its assignments as independently verified.

Source: D32 op7 line21; D18 B12; INP-5 line88
Check: Confirmed gesture state A14. Only original falling piece is controlled under INP-5. Does not authorize input while paused or unlisted A-item changes.

## L08
L08 touchupdate: A14plusnestedmove/softdrop allowedsets;onlyoriginalpiececontrolled. F rest. W31. E1committedmoves retained,no rollback inferred. Source-citation check pending for this row; do not treat its assignments as independently verified.

Source: D32 op8 line22; D18 B12; INP-5 line88; D34 E1 line9; D16 section4 lines76-83
Check: Confirmed A14 and nested move/drop compositions. Already committed moves remain after excursion. Full operation/frame relation remains unproved.

## L09
L09 touchend/cancel: A14none;rotationnestedonlyneverbeyond10px andendswithin10px,notcancel. F restexceptlegalrotation. W32/W33compositehidden relationopen. Source-citation check pending for this row; do not treat its assignments as independently verified.

Source: D32 op9 line23; D33 C2 line11; D34 E1 line9; D18 B12
Check: Confirmed A14 none on end/cancel. Rotation only on end, never cancel, never beyond10px and finalpoint within10px. Previously committed drag effects are not undone.

## L10
L10 move/rotate: A2legal iffits plusA9/A15exactB9.2events. F rest except explicitlynestedlock ifrule triggers. W10,W11,W18. Source-citation check pending for this row; do not treat its assignments as independently verified.

Source: D32 move/rotate line29; D18 B9.2 lines33-43; REQUIREMENTS PLY-1/6 lines41/46
Check: Confirmed A2 plus exact A9/A15 events. Lock only as separately sourced consequence. Unchanged failed fit not a reset grant.

## L11
L11 gravity/softdrop: A2down,A15/A9fallrule;rest/lock consequences separatelynested;softdropgravityrestart runtimeeffect. F others. W12,W13. Source-citation check pending for this row; do not treat its assignments as independently verified.

Source: D32 gravity/softdrop line30; D18 B9.2; PLY-2/3 lines42-43
Check: Confirmed fall A2/A9/A15; softdrop scheduler restart explicitly PLY-3. Lock requires separately sourced composite; no blanket frame permission.

## L12
L12 harddrop: A2landing thenL13lock. W14. Source-citation check pending for this row; do not treat its assignments as independently verified.

Source: D32 harddrop line31; PLY-4 line44
Check: Confirmed A2 to landing then lock. Complete lock composition needed; this row alone does not prove all lock writes.

## L13
L13 lock: A1blocks/rowshift,A7score,A2fromA5,A5refillA6,A6refillwhenempty,A4available,A9zero,A15maxnewpiece;A14no longercontrolsoldpiece;ifnoplaceL18over;completedturnsaveC1 includesnextpiece,nooverturnsave. W15,W16. A3 preserved (exceptlateroversemanticabsence). Source-citation check pending for this row; do not treat its assignments as independently verified.

Source: D32 lock line32; D18 B8/B9.2/B12; D33 C1 line9; SCO-1 line54
Check: Confirmed board/score/current/queue/bag/holdavailable/count/lowest/control-original-piece effects. Completed-turn save includes nextpiece; no save when turn ends over. A3 retention conditional on ordinaryover semanticabsence.

## L14
L14 hold: A2/A3swap orincomingfromA5/A6,A4consume,A9zero/A15newinitial;no-roomL18. W17. Source-citation check pending for this row; do not treat its assignments as independently verified.

Source: D32 hold line33; PLY-7 line47; D18 B8/B9.2; STA-3 line64
Check: Confirmed A2/A3 swap or queue/bag incoming, availability consumed, new count/lowest, no-room ordinaryover. This is successful Hold, not any rejected press.

## L15
L15 pause/pagehidden: A8paused,A9pausecountwhilelockdelay,A13idle;gravity/lock/repeatstopped,save. D32doesnotexplicitlyassignA14forpagehidden,sohiddenreset needsseparatetouchcancelcomposition,not silentlyaddedmask. W08,W33.

Source: D32 pause/pagehidden line34; D18 B9.2/B12/B13; STA-2/4/5 lines63/65/66; D23 U4
Check: Confirmed A8 paused,A13 idle and stopping resources. A9 changes only during lock delay; count15 becomes16. No D32 A14 pagehidden assignment, so touchcancel composition still open.

## L16
L16 resume:A8playing;count16restinglocks immediately,count15restingdelaystarts;heldrepeat suppressionC3/E2/E3,representationopen. A12tokensnotarbitrary newdiscardpermission;A13idleheld-suppressed untilrelease/newpress. W09,W27-W29.

Source: D32 resume line35 (count16); D18 B9.2 line45 explicitly paused resting count15 starts delay; REQUIREMENTS PLY-6 line46; D33 C3 line13; D34 E2/E3 lines11/13
Check: Confirmed A8, restingcount16 instant lock/count15 delay. Every repeating control held at resume suppressed until released/repressed. A12 representation explicitly undecided, not arbitrary discard permission.

## L17
L17 Continue:A1-A9/A15restoredexactly,A8paused;freshbagonlymissingsavebag,A16unchangedC4;controls/cancelprojection requireseparatesources. W07,W21. Do nottreatload-as-spawn resetpermission. Source-citation check pending for this row; do not treat its assignments as independently verified.

Source: D32 Continue line36; D18 B9.2/B16; D33 C4 line15; STA-4/6 lines65/67
Check: Confirmed exact A1-A9/A15 restore paused, freshbag only missingbag, A16 unchanged. Missing legacy resetcount default is not defined by these clauses; do not invent zero.

## L18
L18 ordinaryover:A8over,A16withdraw;allU4timersstop;A2/A3/A4/A6/A9/A14/A15lose semanticvalue,clearingnotrequired;A5stillvalid3,A1/A7retainedunlessauthorized precedinglock effects. W16,W17,W21. Source-citation check pending for this row; do not treat its assignments as independently verified.

Source: D32 ordinaryover line38; D18 B6/B8/B10/B12; STA-3 line64; D21 S2/S9; D23 U4
Check: Confirmed modeover/timerstop/withdraw,A2/A3/A4/A6/A9/A14/A15 semanticabsence,not mandatoryclearing. A5 remains3; A1/A7 retention absent authorized precedinglock. Not fault projection.

## L20

Source: D16 section4 lines76-83; D21 S7/S9 lines21/25; D33 C4 line15; D32 persistence line41/Continue line36
Check: Confirmed external/cache/presentation routes not granted authority; A16 lifetime set only withdraw/attempt, clear sessionstart or successful same-session save. Accepted Continue commits L17 state; external session save does not clear A16.

## Limits
All nineteen row claims are traceable with the conditional/composite qualifications above. Keep Candidate/Not assessed for implementation relations. Most W anchors remain unchecked. The missing legacy count source gap, live UI/focus/physical token/repeat/touch mapping, hostile adapters, dependency coverage, O8 provenance and universal-frame evidence are not closed. The earlier D43 record remains a historical statement of checks pending at that time. This supplement records later bounded citation work, not runtime completion or Phase 3 closure.

## Independent review scope
Independent citation review reported no error and hashed all nine snapshot files against the governed ledger. It checked the cited D32 operation lines and selected D18/D33/D34/requirements clauses, but did not read every clause of L18/L20 B references, the full L08 E1 sentence, every W anchor, runtime relations or original adoption evidence. This is a bounded independent citation review, not exhaustive independent verification.
