# Landing and ledge correspondence (interim)

Production base `0f4e51047ad177a247a3461ed34263599fe01949`, public-identical documentation main `902d5044b64ac12b7ffd53c417e971f1588ba874`. Original comparisons use frozen model revision 4 without edits. Coordinator Node26; independent review Node22. No finding classification, production correction, model acceptance or closure.

The ambiguity labels model-reading A4 and A4b are model tags, not authoritative state item A4 (hold-used). Revision 5 was received as a separate author attachment and frozen by actual byte hash before comparison; its pack-only source review and comparison review are separate from the D41 revision 1-4 record. No executable publication or merge is implied.

## Original revision 4 comparison

Thirty-one predeclared cases combine 25 orientations falling to the floor on an empty board and O moves onto/off a single support at counts 0, 14 and 15. All 25 floor landings agree. Five cases differ:

- Off the ledge at counts 0, 14 and 15: production increments to 1, 15 and 16; model keeps 0, 14 and 15. Both cancel the delay.
- Onto the ledge at counts 0 and 14: production keeps 0 and 14; revision 4 increments to 1 and 15. These are model-reading A4 source/model-mapping issues, not established production deviations.
- Onto the ledge at count 15: both lock at once.

The supplied O spawn (0,4) is a caller reading, not a unique normative choice, and affects only the matching post-lock case. An initial Undefined A2 attempt was discarded and is not counted.

Independent pack-only review found model-reading A4 genuinely ambiguous: the source can be read as consuming a reset only when initially resting or when a move ends resting. Revision 5 exposes both readings through a caller choice or Undefined. Revision 4 evidence is not silently reattributed to revision 5. Later comparisons require their own frozen hash, domain and choice record.

## Separate frozen revision 5 comparison

Revision 5 bytes were frozen at `b7920735e8aebf82c63d7e1e91fb4cbed1b8a26ce6f2668530022a7f62a91156` before this comparison. A strict boolean caller preflight avoids its known truthy-choice harness hazard. The existing 31 input cases are run under absent, false and true choices. Absent choice yields 29 defined cases and two Undefined model-reading A4 traces; full state and random-source rollback were checked and those traces are excluded. False yields three off-ledge count differences; true yields the original five count differences. All 25 floor falls agree under the labeled model-reading A4b unchanged-count reading. Neither choice is selected because it matches production. Independent Node22 comparison review verified the frozen revision 5 source hash and reran all 93 rows byte-identically. The two Undefined cases passed full state/random-source rollback checks; only the count field differs. This is bounded comparison evidence, not oracle acceptance. Original revision 4 evidence remains separate.

## Separate frozen revision 6 comparison

Revision 6 was frozen at `f958f910a7a8ae02e2abd4a25a82f4f6127d5ff41440d45008cb92e4b63e93d2` before comparison. Its strict boolean choice checks fix the revision 5 truthiness hazard; all required boolean choices are preflighted by the harness because the model checks are lazy. The coordinator independently regenerated the 93 comparison rows using the separate revision 6 source. The JSON has the same bytes, size and hash as revision 5 because the defined absent/false/true domain produces the same outcomes, not because the output was copied. Independent Node22 review checked the source hash and code diff, regenerated all 93 rows byte-identically to the stored revision 6 and revision 5 outputs, and regenerated the production data. It also checked bad integer/string/list choices raise ChoiceError with exact state/random-source rollback. These are completed bounded checks; the matching output does not establish oracle acceptance. External storage callbacks still cannot be rewound, and other partial choices and exclusions remain.

## Public off-ledge reachability

A public trace uses New Game O, one hard drop, 16 soft drops onto the locked O, then 13, 14 or 15 surface moves and a move off the ledge. No fields are assigned by the trace. Independent review reproduced the outputs and checked the legal geometry.

- After 13 surface moves, the off-ledge move increments to 14.
- After 14, a further still-resting move consumes restart 15; the next off-ledge move increments to 16.
- After 15, the off-ledge move increments to 16.

All end playing and non-resting with the lock timer cancelled and zero production faults. B9.1 permits count 16 only while paused and resting. The 14/15 traces therefore support a strong bounded B9.1/count-16 candidate. Treating the 13-to-14 increment as a deviation additionally depends on reading a cancellation as distinct from a restart. No later pause or landing at count 16 was executed in this class; no model run is claimed for the public trace.

These remain separate source, model, implementation and mapping investigations. No production observations go to the clean author. Empty-board/single-support/O, fake scheduler, successful storage and a narrow count domain are limits. No all-reachable-state, rotation-history, real-deadline, bag/queue or storage proof is claimed. This record is not part of current PR77.
